<h2>This is one of my first projects, so do not judge strictly</h2>
<p>The project is implemented in python, and is designed to search for quotes by keywords, as well as to add/delete/edit quotes.<p>
<h2>Start</h2>
<p>This application is designed using the "Django" framework and in order for the project to start you need to install this framework</p>
<p> I used <em>conda</em> to isolate the development environment and used <em>pip</em> as the package manager to install it</p>
<p>After you need to call the git clone command:</p>

Use `git clone https://github.com/Anigirka/siteQuotesPython.git`
<p>After in created environment with django packagen call the commands one by one:</p>

`cd .\siteQuotesPython\` to go to a directory with `manage.py` 
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
<p>That's all it takes to start the server</p>
<p>You can open the site from the link  http://127.0.0.1:8000/</p>
<p> To enter the admin page enter</p>

```
login: admin
password: siteqoutes
```
